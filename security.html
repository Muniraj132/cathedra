    <b>Client Data:</b> Client Data is any and all data that the Client has disclosed to Service Provider. For the purposes of this Agreement, Client Data does not cease to be Client Data solely because it is transferred or transmitted beyond the Client’s immediate possession, custody, or control.
    <br/><br/>
<b> Data Breach:</b> The unauthorized access and acquisition of computerized data that materially compromises the security or confidentiality of confidential or sensitive personal information maintained by the Client as part of a database of personal information regarding multiple individuals and that causes or the Client reasonably believes has caused or will cause loss or injury to any Client constituent
    <br/><br/>
<b> System:</b> An assembly of components that supports an operational role or accomplishes a specific objective.

    <br/><br/>
<b>Change Management:</b> A formal process used to ensure that changes to a system are introduced in a controlled and coordinated manner.
